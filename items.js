      "description": "========= AUTHENTIC PERSONALIZED CHOPPING BLOCKS =========\n\n\n• One-of-a-kind handcrafted chopping blocks\n• Made-to-order from premium cherry, sapele or walnut wood.\n• Chopping Blocks are 1.75 inches\n• Finished with food grade safe board conditioner \n\n\n===================== 4 EASY ORDER STEPS =====================\n\n\nStep 1:\n\n&gt; Select wood from drop-down menu. All chopping blocks come with a juice groove and handles. Engraving will be added to the back side of the chopping block -- the side without the juice groove.\n\nStep 2:\n\n&gt; Add to cart.\n\nStep 3:\n\n&gt; This design comes “as is” shown in the photo. If you would like to add an additional line of text to the design (i.e. first name of a person), enter it into the “add an optional note to seller” box at checkout. \n\nSTEP 4:\n\n \t&gt; Proceed to checkout and that&#39;s it :) Now you can relax and wait for us to do our part! \n\n\n========================== DISCLAIMER ==========================\n\n\nAll chopping blocks are natural wood and may appear slightly different in color and grain than what is pictured. No two pieces of wood are exactly alike. This is what adds to the true beauty of it. Please allow for engraving color variations as well. I do not accept returns or refunds as these are made-to-order items and cannot be resold. However, I will replace a chopping block if I&#39;m at fault.",

We use USPS because it is the most cost efficient for our customers, and is usually the fastest method. We will always honor our commitment to get your items finished by the date promised (Etsy will let you know the date it should ship by). Once your item is marked shipped, it is then given to USPS to complete for delivery. Once USPS has possession of your item, we cannot control the amount of time it takes to get to you. The only service time that is guaranteed is Express Shipping. \n\nIf you ever have any questions about when an order will arrive, or if you need it by a certain date, please let us know before you place the order, or soon after. Once the item ships out, we can&#39;t control when it will arrive. But if you let us know ahead of time, we can provide suggestions and do everything we can to meet your deadline!\n\nThank you for visiting Dream SocieTEE (branded by Lifting the Dream)!",

Engraved oak has beautiful contrast, it can have marked graining that will be revealed. \n Engraving process is a burning process by high density laser beam that doesn&#39;t provide coloration and engraving color is solely depends on that particular piece of wood and how it reacts to laser beam.\n Seasoned with food safe oil prior to shipping. Then you can treat it as needed with a food safe mineral oil.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR USE\n\nWood alone can not protect your board from abuse and neglect. All wood cutting boards usually require regular maintenance with mineral oil or beeswax to keep the wood from cracking and warping. Additionally, we do not recommend putting any of our boards in the dishwasher, or letting it soak in water for a long period of time. This will lead to splitting and damage to the wood.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSHIPPING INFORMATION:\nShipping worldwide from Ukraine\n- We guarantee shipping within 6 - 8 working days after payment\n- The delivery time from Ukraine: 10-25 days\n- Item will be quality packed with tracking numbers\n\nWedding Gift Cutting Board / Personalized Engraved Cutting Board / Bride and Groom / Personalized Cutting Board / Star Wars cutting board",

Engraved oak has beautiful contrast, it can have marked graining that will be revealed. \n Engraving process is a burning process by high density laser beam that doesn&#39;t provide coloration and engraving color is solely depends on that particular piece of wood and how it reacts to laser beam.\n Seasoned with food safe oil prior to shipping.

All wood cutting boards usually require regular maintenance with mineral oil or beeswax to keep the wood from cracking and warping. Additionally, we do not recommend putting any of our boards in the dishwasher, or letting it soak in water for a long period of time. This will lead to splitting and damage to the wood.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSHIPPING INFORMATION:\nShipping worldwide from Ukraine\n- We guarantee shipping within 6 - 8 working days after payment\n- The delivery time from Ukraine: 10-25 days\n- Item will be quality packed with tracking numbers\n\nWedding Gift Cutting Board / Personalized Engraved Cutting Board / Bride and Groom / Personalized Cutting Board / Star Wars cutting board",

You can reference the Etsy Privacy Policy to learn more about its privacy practices. \n\n1. Information I Collect\n\nTo fulfil your order, you must provide me with certain information (which you authorized Etsy to provide to me), such as your name, email address, postal address, payment information, and the details of the product that you’re ordering. You may also choose to provide me with additional personal information (for a custom order, for example), if you contact me directly.\n\n2. Why I Need Your Information and How I Use It\n\nI rely on a number of legal bases to collect, use, and share your information, including:\n\nas needed to provide my services, such as when I use your information to fulfil your order, to settle disputes, or to provide customer support;\nwhen you have provided your affirmative consent, which you may revoke at any time, such as by signing up for my mailing list;\nif necessary to comply with a legal obligation or court order or in connection with a legal claim, such as retaining information about your purchases if required by tax law; and\nas necessary for the purpose of my legitimate interests, if those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests, such as 1) providing and improving my services. I use your information to provide the services you requested and in my legitimate interest to improve my services; and 2) Compliance with the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use. I use your information as necessary to comply with my obligations under the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use.\n\n3. Information Sharing and Disclosure\n\nInformation about my customers is important to my business. I share your personal information for very limited reasons and in limited circumstances, as follows:\n\nEtsy. I share information with Etsy as necessary to provide you my services and comply with my obligations under both the Etsy Seller Policy and Etsy Terms of Use.\nService providers. I engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to my shop, such as delivery companies. I will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these services.\nBusiness transfers. If I sell or merge my business, I may disclose your information as part of that transaction, only to the extent permitted by law.\nCompliance with laws. I may collect, use, retain, and share your information if I have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond to legal process or to government requests; (b) enforce my agreements, terms and policies; (c) prevent, investigate, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of my customers, or others.\n\n4. Data Retention\n\nI retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with my services and as described in my Privacy Policy. However, I may also be required to retain this information to comply with my legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce my agreements. I generally keep your data for the following time period: 4 years.\n\n5. Transfers of Personal Information Outside the EU\n\nI may store and process your information through third-party hosting services in the US and other jurisdictions. As a result, I may transfer your personal information to a jurisdiction with different data protection and government surveillance laws than your jurisdiction. If I am deemed to transfer information about you outside of the EU, I rely on Privacy Shield as the legal basis for the transfer, as Google Cloud is Privacy Shield certified.\n\n6. Your Rights\n\nIf you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. I describe these rights below:\n\nAccess. You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information I hold about you by contacting me using the contact information below.\nChange, restrict, delete. You may also have rights to change, restrict my use of, or delete your personal information. Absent exceptional circumstances (like where I am required to store data for legal reasons) I will generally delete your personal information upon request.\nObject. You can object to (i) my processing of some of your information based on my legitimate interests and (ii) receiving marketing messages from me after providing your express consent to receive them. In such cases, I will delete your personal information unless I have compelling and legitimate grounds to continue using that information or if it is needed for legal reasons.\nComplain. If you reside in the EU and wish to raise a concern about my use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local data protection authority.\n\n7. How to Contact Me\n\nFor purposes of EU data protection law, I, María del Carmen Idrovo Carrillo am the data controller of your personal information. If you have any questions or concerns, you may contact me at marigurumi.shop@gmail.com\n\nThank you!",

Makes a great surprise if you are seeing it for the first time. It is 7in by 4 in and I can adjust the size bigger or smaller. It is mainly opaque black glass other than the eyes which are an amber color when put in light. It also has some texture to add more menace to it.\n\nIf you want one of these for yourself pick one up now! After the order has been put in I will message you to talk over any fine details you would like to change.\n\nI do thoroughly package every item and insure them against breakage while in transit.

NO REFUNDS, EXCHANGES, UNLESS FOR RESIZING.  \n\nWHY USUALLY??? during busy periods we may take longer than the standard 2-3 week period to process an order.\nSome items take longer to make than others.  Although each of our listings is clearly marked with our 2-3 week processing period, some items such as couple sets that have several tones of plating will take more time to make.  We make each piece from raw material as the order is placed.  Some items with certain plating processes take more than the usual time to make.  \n\nPLEASE READ CAREFULLY AS THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT:  We ship most orders with tracking via regular mail service using more than one carrier which depends on several factors such as what country the order is shipping to.  Once you receive a shipping notification, the tracking number will be provided to you so that you may follow the progress of the shipment.  WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE INFORMATION FOR YOU ABOUT YOUR SHIPMENT INCLUDING WHERE IT IS OR WHEN IT WILL BE DELIVERED than what you see on the carriers website.  We only use reliable carriers to ship orders.  Please track your packages yourself on the carriers websites with the tracking number provided to you.  We are not the carrier who delivers your orders and therefore, please do not get upset with us for your shipment taking longer to arrive than expected.  We do not guarantee shipping and/or delivery dates.  We have NO control over ship times.  We have no control if your parcel is stuck at customs.  We have had several orders held up at customs for 3-4 weeks and we do not take responsibility for any late delivery.  If you are in a rush and require express shipping please notify us BEFORE you place your order.  Leaving a note with your order that states a required by date does NOT guarantee that your order will arrive by that date.  We will not be held responsible for any delays or missed birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, surprise parties, and other important dates.  If you do not agree with this policy PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM US!!!!!!!  All our items are hand made to order and we complete your order as soon as we can.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM US UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE WITH THE POLICY MENTIONED ABOVE!  We understand that not every buyer has read this section of our shop prior to placing their order and may have ended up here because they are upset that their order has taken longer to make than expected.  We hope that you now understand why it is taking longer than usual to make your order and that you appreciate that we are upfront and honest about our business.  We are a customer satisfaction driven shop and it is to our benefit to make you satisfied with the product you receive from us.  That is why we take longer than usual to make our products.  If you need a rush on your order please message us.  We are here to help!    \n\nRush/expedite service will always be available for an additional fee.  Please convo us for more details. \n\n***Our goal is to keep our listings for sale as fairly priced as possible.  In order to cut shipping costs we use a fulfillment center that is located overseas to ship MOST of our orders.  The fulfillment center packages our orders in an elegant velvet ring box FREE of charge to our buyers, then packages the ring box in a corrugated box, and uses our pre-printed shipping labels to ship the package to you.  We are able to offer many of our listings with FREE shipping due to this cost saving fulfillment process.  WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION, EVERY SINGLE ITEM WE MAKE IS CUSTOM LASER ENGRAVED IN OUR SHOP IN TORONTO, CANADA.  WE DO NOT STOCK INVENTORY, EACH ORDER IS CUSTOM MADE TO ORDER.***\n\nCUSTOM ORDERS: If you wish us to make you a custom order, we will gladly do so.  Variations in such things as color, size, symbol, logo, model, are flexible and we will answer any questions that you may have.  We can also create a mock up for your custom piece for you to see prior to ordering.  A mock up fee will be required, however, will be reimbursed once you place the order.   \n\nCUSTOM ORDERS INSTRUCTIONS: Any and all of your custom order instructions must be noted in the notes section of your order, before you check out.  DO NOT rely on email conversations to leave us instructions or requests about your order. We have too many conversations with buyers to keep track of order instructions or requests. Any special instructions about your order must be noted in your order in the notes to seller box before you check out. If you do not leave your instructions in the notes section we will not be held responsible if they are not followed or completed. You may ask any questions you wish about what you want to have done, but you must leave the final request in the notes section.  \n\nNon fulfillment center orders are shipped from Canada via Canada Post Tracked Packet which guarantees delivery within 6 business days anywhere in Canada and the US.  From years of experience with this shipping method, we found that packages are delivered within 4-5 business days in Canada and the US.  We are not responsible for longer than expected ship times resulting from delays in customs or for any other reason.  On some occasions, a signature will be required as proof of delivery using this shipping method.  International points of destination may take up to several additional days to arrive.  We usually ship all standard orders on average 2 - 3 weeks after order has been placed.  However, we usually ship orders much faster than that.  We believe that it is better to be honest and over deliver than to be late.  From time to time we do experience a longer than usual lead time and we will be in contact with our customers on such occasions.  For example, if a customer requires a special order for a blue ring in a custom size, we may need extra time to make such a custom ring size.  We hold the right to take longer to make and ship each order and you will be advised immediately.  Any rush or express service will be gladly accommodated, simply send us a covo request with your special instructions.  If you&#39;d like to have your package shipped with insurance coverage please let us know asap.  \n\nPACKAGING: Most orders are packaged in a small envelope with your packing slip that is wrapped in a heavy duty plastic bag and wrapped with shipping tape.  Most orders DO NOT come with ring boxes.  Shipping rings in ring boxes from Canada is very expensive and we want to keep your fees as low as possible.  If you wish for us to include a ring box for your order please leave us a note with your order.  We will then let you know how much extra shipping fees you&#39;ll need to pay.  Please understand that we want you to wear our jewelry at affordable prices and this is the only way we can keep prices down.  We package orders in a way that avoids most possibilities of being damaged in transit.      \n\nEach ring is custom made to order and each ring is CUSTOM LASER ENGRAVED. We do not stock any rings.\n\n- We are not responsible for any lost or stolen packages from or to us.\n\n- We are not responsible for damage your ring receives while in transport from or to us.\n\n- ANY model, ANY design, ANY Metal, ANY color, ANY font, ANY text, ANY logo, ANY wild idea, we can make for you.  (Please note that some metals have color plating limitations.  For example, Tungsten rings are only available in the following colors: Silver (chrome), Black, Blue, Rose gold, Yellow Gold).  Please inquire if you wish to find out more information about custom orders.  We will gladly answer all your questions.  \n\nLast updated May 4, 2016.",

NO REFUNDS, EXCHANGES, UNLESS FOR RESIZING.  \r\n\r\nWE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET YOUR FINGER PROFESSIONALLY MEASURED BEFORE PLACING YOUR ORDER.  \r\n\r\nTo exchange a ring for a different size, please send us a convo request.  We will instruct you how to proceed.  It will be the buyer&#39;s responsibility (at your cost) to ship us the wrongly sized ring.  Once we receive it, we will inspect it to make sure it is in its original condition.  We will charge you once again for shipping the item to you.  We will then ship you the proper sized ring. To avoid these hassles and unnecessary costs please get your finger professionally measured.  We have also provided a link below.   \r\n\r\nNeed help figuring out your ring size?  Visit http://www.findmyringsize.com\r\n\r\n****SHOP ANNOUNCEMENT as of April 1, 2016.  We are pleased to announce that due to a large volume of requests from buyers to exchange their ring due to incorrect size, we have changed our policy and will offer you to purchase the same ring at our cost.  You are no longer required to ship us back the original ring.  We have decided to make it easier on our customers and ship them the properly sized ring at a cost even lower than returning the ring (shipping + restocking fee).  Please message us for more details.  PLEASE NOTE: custom orders (engravings) will be subjected to custom fees.  We will also allow you to customize your newly sized ring.  For example, if your original (wrongly sized) ring did not have a special message engraved inside the ring, but you would like it to be added to the new, properly sized ring, we will do so for you for no extra charge (if the extra engraving requires a custom design, we will let you know the price).  Please message us for more details.  \r\n\r\nCUSTOM ORDERS (CUSTOM ENGRAVING) ARE FINAL SALE AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR RETURNS OR EXCHANGES.\r\n\r\nQuestions?

In order to submit a claim please keep all your purchase documentation and convo us for details.  \n\n***ALL OUR RINGS ARE CUSTOM ENGRAVED WITH OUR COMPANY LOGO INSIDE THE RING.  IF YOU WISH FOR US TO OMIT OUR COMPANY BRANDING FROM INSIDE THE RING, PLEASE MESSAGE US IMMEDIATELY***\n\nALL ITEMS WE SELL ARE MADE TO ORDER.  ALL SALES ARE FINAL.  NO REFUNDS, EXCHANGES, UNLESS FOR RESIZING.  \n\nEach ring is custom made to order and each ring is CUSTOM LASER ENGRAVED. We do not stock any rings.\n\nAlthough Tungsten Carbide rings are scratch resistant due to their hardness, tungsten rings will shatter if hit with a hard surface.  If you do not have experience with tungsten or titanium jewelry we encourage you to research these metals prior to ordering.\n\nTungsten&#39;s natural color is a shiny silver (chrome) and is not as bright as Sterling silver. If you&#39;re not familiar with the color of Tungsten please do your research or visit your local jewellery store to see it first hand.  We will not honor returns or refunds due to the darker tone when compared to Sterling Silver or anything to do with coloring of the ring.  Also, natural colored tungsten is very shiny and reflects light, much like a mirror.  Natural colored tungsten is NOT solid silver and will reflect the colors of the background.  If the ring is placed near a dark object, the ring will reflect black colors the same as a mirror.\n\nQuestions? We&#39;d love to help!\n\n******PHOTOGRAPHY******\n\nWe spend countless hours taking photos of our products.  Please understand that some pictures are slightly retouched for exposure, background color, sharpness, hue, warmth.  Please understand that it is virtually impossible to take photos of this type of material that is 100% exactly the same as the item in real life.  All of our photos are real representations of the item for sale.  We do not create any 3D images via software like most of our competition.  What you see is what you get!   ***Some products we list for sale may have an image(s) that intends to show instructions or to assist in making a certain point.  For example, we usually provide an image that assists in measuring finger size on your own.  This type of an image is NOT a real photograph.  \n\nSome of the laser engravings may be darker or lighter than pictured, the darker the symbol - the deeper the laser has etched into the metal. We will NOT exchange or replace or refund any items because of darkness/lightness of the laser engravings.  Also, engraved symbols on thinner width bands are more difficult to see and may lose some detail - please realize this when ordering your ring.\n\nAll colored rings are plated and will scratch if not treated carefully. We ship out only brand new, unused, and unworn rings. All colored rings will show some degree of wear over time.  We do not replace, exchange, or refund any rings due to color wear and tear.  \n\nCreating tungsten in other colors besides its natural color, a special chemical process called &quot;electroplating&quot; is required.  Tungsten rings are placed in a solution bath containing special chemical (coloring) agent that bond to the metal.  It is important to note that most electroplated rings may have a very thin line on the interior of the ring where it has been hung from into the bath. This thin line is called a &quot;hang&quot; mark and is not a defect. Some colors may have slightly different shades from one ring to another.\n\nAny instructions including engraving instructions must be finalized in the &quot;note to seller&quot; box while at check out. We are not responsible for checking previous messages that contain instructions in regards to your order. All instructions during checkout must be complete and all additional engraving will be engraved INSIDE . Any engraving outside of the rings other than what is pictured in the listing is considered CUSTOM and will have additional costs. \n\nAll rings are laser engraved using state of the art machines.  Symbols will wear away if rubbed or hit on hard surfaces. We do not refund of exchange rings because the symbols are rubbing off due to mistreatment. \n\n******SIZING*****\n\nIf you receive a ring that you feel is not in the size you ordered, please convo us for further instructions.  If we find that we shipped you the wrong size in error we will replace it for you FREE of charge.  However, if we find that the ring size is the one you ordered we will charge you a fee to have it replaced for the proper size.  The fee will usually be $25.00 plus shipping.\n\nWe want your business and will work hard for it.  Please let us know if you have any questions.  We usually reply right away.  We welcome any custom order inquiry.  \n\nVisit us for more great sports themed designs at www.scorejewelry.com\n\nWe will continue to update this section of our terms and conditions regularly.  \n\nLast updated Dec 28, 2015.",
